When called within a Lager project with the `@lager/api-gateway` plugin installed and activated, the `lager` command will be enriched with subcommands
to work with `@lager/api-gateway`.

The `create-api` and `create-endpoint` sub-commands help to create the structure of the project.

The `inspect-api` and `inspect-endpoint` sub-commands help to check the configuration of APIs and endpoints.

The `deploy-apis` sub-command allows to deploy one or more APIs in Amazon API Gateway.
